    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>The target audience would include people who are living within the covered areas, or those
      who are visiting these areas within Idaho. The audience would include young kids doing weather
      reports for school, to teens who are wondering what the weather will be for the big dance, to
      adults who want to know what if it will rain on their wedding day. The audience is out
      community, who want a reliable place to look for weather reports from people who understand
      their community.</p>
    <h2>Persona One</h2>
    <p>The first persona is a woman in her 30s, who has a family of three. She and her husband love
      taking their kids on fun outings. She loves volunteering for community events, helping plan
      and run them. She would use this site to see the local forecast, so that she could help plan
      county fairs, dances, parades, etc. on good weather days. She would also use this site to
      check weather for outings with her family, to ensure they have a good day, and to make sure
      that her children dress for the appropriate weather.</p>
    <h2>Persona Two</h2>
    <p>The second persona is a man in his late 40s, early 50s, who loves to fish, hunt, and go
      hiking. He is married, whose children have grown, so he has time to spend on his hobbies. He
      would use this site to plan trips and see what the forecast will be for specific areas within
      Idaho. It would help him know what the weather would be like for different regions, so he
      would know which lake, or which trail he would want to visit. The forecast would also help him
      plan his trip, making sure he brings the correct gear.</p>
    <h2>Five Scenarios</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A child is doing a report on weather, and has been asked to research local weather
        patterns, and check the local forecast.</li>
      <li>A mother is planning a birthday party for her daughter. She is planning to have the party
        outside, but wants to make sure she picks a sunny day.</li>
      <li>The community fair is this weekend, and a father wants to take his children on Saturday,
        and he wants to know if his children should dress warmly.</li>
      <li>A young couple is planning a weekend camping trip near Soda Springs, and they want to know
        what the local weather will be in the area.</li>
      <li>A school is planning a field trip, and they need to know the ten-day forecast, to make
        sure the bus will have good conditions to drive in.</li>
    </ol>
